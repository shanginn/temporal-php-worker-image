# Base Docker image for Temporal PHP worker

This is minimal image based on PHP cli-alpine official image.

Because of awesome [PHP extension installer](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer) project
I'm able to build an image only 150mb in size!

This image used in the [Temporal PHP worker project](https://github.com/shanginn/temporal-php-worker)
